When we began Depth First Learning during the Google AI Residency, we wanted to find a
better way to study and understand important machine learning papers and ideas.
We found that many papers often assumed a set of requisite knowledge, which
prevented us from deeply appreciating the contribution or novelty of the work.

To this end, we designed Depth First Learning, a pedagogy for diving deep by
carefully tailoring a curriculum around a particular ML paper or concept and
leading small, focused discussion groups. So far, we've created guides for
<a href="http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/2018/InfoGAN">InfoGAN</a>, <a href="http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/2018/TRPO">TRPO</a>, <a
href="http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/2018/AlphaGoZero">AlphaGoZero</a>, and <a
href="http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/2018/DeepStack">DeepStack</a>.

Since our launch, weâ€™ve received very positive feedback from students and
researchers around the world. **Now, we want to run new, online classes around the
world.**

We intimately understand that the process of curating a meaningful curriculum
with reading materials, practice problems, and instructive discussion points can
be very rewarding, but also time-consuming and difficult. We wanted to make sure
that the people compiling the content understood that their efforts were well
worth their time and consequently decided to launch a fellowship program.

**Thanks to the generosity of <a href="http://www.janestreet.com">Jane Street</a>, we will provide 4 fellows
with a $4000 grant each to build a 6 week curriculum and run weekly on-line discussions.**

If you'd like to lead a class about an important paper in machine learning, please visit <a href="http://fellowship.depthfirstlearning.com">http://fellowship.depthfirstlearning.com</a> to apply. We look forward to hearing from you!
