Welcome! We made this for you. 

Why? Because there's a flood of information out there on machine learning and it
is woefully insufficient in two ways that we all recognize.

The first is that while there is a terrific amount of resources online for
picking up machine learning in 24 hours, there is not nearly as much that treats
this as a ten year endeavor. When you start thinking that way, you really want
to consider the trunk of your tree foremost before each convolutional leaf.

The second is that there is no bridge from where we came from before to where we
are today. Without that, it is really hard to insightfully propose directions on
where to go. For example, it is one thing to understand how an algorithm like TRPO
works but all together another to grasp why the authors made the choices that they
did and what they knew before that to influence those choices.

This public repository of depth-first study plans is the outcome of an effort to
address those shortcomings in the machine learning research world. DFL was
designed to be shared with and grown by the community. If you are interested in developing your own 
curriculum for a paper that we do not already host, **we will help you!** Check out
<a href="https://github.com/depthfirstlearning/depthfirstlearning.com#contributing">Github</a>
for examples and open an <a href="https://github.com/depthfirstlearning/depthfirstlearning.com/issues">issue</a>
detailing which paper you want to study. We want your help in growing this resource
and making it richer.

### How are we different?

Depth First Learning (DFL) is inspired by many modern resources on the Internet. Here, we discuss how each of those tools are different (but complementary to) DFL:

- **Textbooks**: These are often the de facto method of learning. We cannot and do not try to match the depth that they cover in a vast domain. Instead, Depth First Learning aims to to create a curriculum that provides a suitable depth for a single modern paper.
- **Online courses**: Online courses provide a very different experience. While they are fantastic at reaching almost everyone in the world, they tend to organize around a similar, broad set of topics like textbooks do. 
- **Blogs**: Blog posts are a copious resource in our community. They provide a counter to textbooks in that they frequently cover just a single paper or idea and can be a very welcome accompaniment to our own reading. In contrast to Depth First Learning, they generally are not a series of targeted learnings and are insufficient when it comes to deep understanding for anyone but the authors.
- **[distill.pub](https://distill.pub/)**: Distill.pub has beautiful and thorough explanations for machine learning phenomena and often seek to explain it in a very visual manner, sometimes with new insights about the underlying mathematics. Distill.pub may also span multiple papers and cover a broader area of interest to machine learning practioners. Depth First Learning serves instead to unify resources needed to understand a single paper deeply by providing the right resources and topics to study from. 
- **[Metacademy](https://metacademy.org/)**: Metacademy is the closest parallel to Depth First Learning. We were inspired by this service and have similar goals in improving the learning process through breaking down concepts into their parents and gaining a more solid understanding. However, we ultimately have different foci as Depth First Learning is built around understanding significant machine learning papers in particular and consequentially increasing the strength of the field itself.
